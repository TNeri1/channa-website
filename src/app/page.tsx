                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Hurghada's rapid tourism growth has led to environmental concerns, particularly affecting its marine ecosystems. 
                      The expansion of coastal tourism has resulted in localized pollution, habitat loss, and resource depletion, 
                      threatening the health of coral reefs and marine biodiversity.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                      The influx of tourists has strained Hurghada's infrastructure, leading to overcrowding and challenges in waste management. 
                      Additionally, the dominance of tourism has impacted local cultural practices, with traditional lifestyles adapting to 
                      meet tourist demands, potentially diluting cultural authenticity.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Jordan has been proactive in promoting sustainable tourism, implementing policies to protect natural resources and

                      Aqaba's tourism development emphasizes community involvement, ensuring that local cultures and traditions are respected

                      Developed a comprehensive analysis of key economic principles that drive decision-making in the 
                      hospitality and tourism industries, highlighting how these concepts impact business operations, 
                      pricing strategies, and market dynamics.

                    <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-3">Key Economic Concepts</h3>
                    
                    <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Understanding Economics</h4>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Economics is the study of how individuals and businesses allocate limited resources to satisfy their needs and wants. 
                      In the hospitality industry, this involves understanding supply and demand, revenue management, and consumer behavior 
                      to maximize profitability.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Sequential Value in the Supply Chain</h4>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Sequential value refers to the step-by-step process of adding value to a product or service before it reaches the final consumer. 
                      In tourism, this could mean the journey from airline ticket booking to hotel stays and local attractions. Each step must create 
                      value to enhance customer satisfaction and encourage repeat business.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">How Markets Determine Pricing</h4>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Pricing in the hospitality industry is influenced by factors such as demand, competition, and costs. Businesses use strategies 
                      like dynamic pricing, where hotel room rates and airline ticket prices fluctuate based on seasonality and customer demand.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Shifters of Demand</h4>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Demand in the hospitality industry can change due to several factors, including consumer income, preferences, external economic 
                      conditions, and special events. Understanding these shifts helps businesses adjust their marketing strategies and pricing models accordingly.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Franchising in the Hospitality Industry</h4>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Franchising allows businesses to expand while leveraging an established brand name and operational model. Popular franchises in 
                      hospitality include global hotel chains like Marriott and Hilton, as well as fast-food brands such as McDonald's and Subway. 
                      This model benefits both franchisees and franchisors through shared resources and brand recognition.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">The Role of Competition</h4>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Competition drives innovation and improves service quality in the hospitality industry. Businesses must differentiate themselves 
                      through pricing, unique experiences, and customer service to stay ahead in the market. Strategies such as loyalty programs and 
                      exclusive offers help build a strong customer base.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Unemployment and Its Impact on Hospitality</h4>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Unemployment affects both labor supply and consumer spending in the hospitality industry. A high unemployment rate can reduce 
                      travel and leisure spending, while a labor shortage can make it difficult for businesses to provide quality service. Understanding 
                      economic trends helps businesses plan for workforce management.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Minimum Wage and Its Economic Influence</h4>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Minimum wage policies impact the hospitality industry by influencing labor costs and employment rates. While higher wages improve 
                      employee satisfaction and reduce turnover, they also increase operational costs. Businesses must find a balance between fair wages 
                      and financial sustainability.
                    </p>

                      By applying these concepts, businesses can develop more effective pricing strategies, adapt to market changes, optimize their supply chains, 
                      and make informed decisions about expansion and labor management.
